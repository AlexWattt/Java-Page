  <p><ul>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented[15] (although not a pure OO language, as it contains primitive types[16]), and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2018, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]</ul></p>

  <p><ul>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[24] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[25] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee.[26] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[27]]</ul></p>
          <p>
          <ul>  Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[28] It promised ‘Write Once, Run Anywhere’ (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[29] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</ul>
          </p>
          <p> 
         <ul>   In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[30][31][32] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[33] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System </ul>

          <h2><ul>Java JVM and Bytecode</ul></h2>
  <p><ul>One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java applets.</ul></p>
          <p>
           <ul> Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.</ul>
          </p>
          <p>
         <ul>   The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine for it, which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.[46] </ul>

  <p><ul>Criticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics,[61] speed,[62] the handling of unsigned numbers,[63] the implementation of floating-point arithmetic,[64] and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot.[65]</ul>

          <p><ul>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</ul></p>
          <p>
          <ul>
  <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
  <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
  <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
              <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>

              <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
